# Ollama

To use Ollama with `psaisuite` you will need to download and install Ollama https://ollama.com.

Prior to using a model for the first time you will have to download it using `ollama pull <model>`

It is possible to use a remote ollama server by setting $env:OLLAMA_HOST. 

If you are using authentication on the remote server you will also need to pass the $env:OllamaKey.

## Create a Chat Completion
